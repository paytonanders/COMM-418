## Data Story 1.27.26
### Most Immigrants Arrested in City Crackdowns Have No Criminal Record
The New York Times interactive used a detailed dataset obtained from ICE, released by the Deportation Data Project after a public-records request, to examine who has been arrested in the agency’s nationwide interior enforcement operations in 2025. The lead reporter analyzed hundreds of thousands of records to obtain this data and analyze it for the story, finding that a large number of people arrested by ICE had no prior criminal convictions, even though federal officials have repeatedly emphasized that the focus is on detaining “dangerous criminals.” In many major city campaigns, including Washington, D.C., Los Angeles, Chicago and Massachusetts, most of those taken into custody lacked criminal records, contradicting the government’s framing that enforcement targets the “worst of the worst.” The reporters also showed that arrest rates have surged compared with previous years and that the composition of those apprehended increasingly includes people with no criminal history, prompting legal challenges and debate over the legality and goals of these operations.
