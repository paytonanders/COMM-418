This data-driven investigation found that genetic and brain data from more than 20,000 U.S. children, collected through a federally funded NIH study, were accessed by outside researchers and misused to produce papers promoting discredited “race science” claims about intelligence and social outcomes. The reporters used data journalism not by reanalyzing the genetic data themselves, but by tracing the origins of the dataset, documenting how it was accessed, and identifying at least 16 publications that drew on it. They contextualized these findings with expert critiques from geneticists, who explained why the research was scientifically flawed, and showed how the data misuse amplified racist narratives online—highlighting failures in data governance and oversight rather than new biological discoveries.
