Dear California Secretary of State,

Pursuant to the state open records law Cal. Gov't Code Secs. 7920 to 7931, I write to request access to and a copy of the following records for the most recent election cycle in the state of California: 
* Poll worker training manuals, handbooks, guides, or instructional materials 
* Training presentations, slide decks, videos, or online modules 
* Written policies or procedures provided to poll workers regarding voter eligibility, ballot handling, provisional ballots, voter assistance, and election security 
* Training materials addressing voter challenges, electioneering, accessibility requirements, or de-escalation procedures 

Any updates, revisions, or guidance documents distributed to poll workers during this period I request that these records be provided in electronic format where possible (PDFs, slides, or other native digital formats). If your agency does not maintain these public records, please let me know who does and include the proper custodian's name and address.

I agree to pay any reasonable copying and postage fees of not more than $100. If the cost would be greater than this amount, please notify me. Please provide a receipt indicating the charges for each document.

As provided in the open records law, Sec. 6253(c), I will expect your response within ten (10) business days. See Cal. Gov’t Code Sec. 7922.535(a).

If you choose to deny this request, please provide a written explanation for the denial including a reference to the specific statutory exemption(s) upon which you rely. Also, please provide all segregable portions of otherwise exempt material.

I would note that willful violation of the open records law can result in the award of court costs and reasonable attorney fees. See Cal. Gov’t Code Sec. 7923.115(a).

Thank you for your assistance.

Sincerely,

Payton Anderson
