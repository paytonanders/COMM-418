This data story is the perfect example of how you can start with a question and imagine data sets for it. That is, no data set existed before this article to answer how exactly figure skating was getting more competitive for men and women in terms of what skills were being executed. The Post collected its own data for the story by counting "every airborne rotation attempted by men’s and women’s figure skaters in the free skate, the final segment in the two-event competition, in each Games over the past 20 years." They found that, based on the number of average spins per program, there has been an increase, but only by 3 spins and 6 for women since 2006. The reporters preface that this is logistical since judges have limited the number of spins, but I wish the reporters had not then begun the story with this failed statistic. If the data isn't complete, why include it? However, the visualization of the data is very intriguing and does bring the reader back into the story. I would have led with the data and graphs that appear later in the story, which show the specific changes in evaluations and skills performed by female and male skaters.
