### HED: 2024 Use of Force Data Suggests Holes in MPD's Annual Bias Trainings

The Metropolitan Police Department has long prided itself on being one of the most diverse police departments in the country, but the recent use-of-force data from 2024 raises concerns about how MPD is practicing unbiased policing. 

Following an audit from the Office of the D.C. Auditor conducted last year, MPD was found lacking in anti-racial-bias training. According to a report from Open Data D.C., 92 percent of MPD’s reported cases of use of force and arrests were Black. [Name 1] said this is not uncommon for the department, as in 2023 and 2022, X and X percent were X. 

“Quote on why anti-bias training is important,” [Name 1] said. 

[Name] said this is not an issue of who is part of MPD, as the data shows the majority of officers reporting use of force in 2024 were Black, but on how they are trained to use it. 

“Quote on what happens with no anti-bias training, increase in force,” [Name 1] said. 

In 2023, X cases were reported compared to over 2000 in 2024. Of these cases, nearly 27 percent were reported in Ward 7, an overwhelmingly Black and Brown community. Additionally, 25 percent of MPD officers who reported use of force were assigned to Ward 7. 

[Name 1] said the over policing of Wards seven, eight and five, in addition to the lack of anti-bias training for officers, continues to be a concern for the community. 

“Quote on why this is concerning, how they feel about it, and maybe how the community feels,” [Name 1] said.   

Although the racial makeup of MPD may not correspond to the use of force and arrest data, the gender makeup is, [Name] said. According to the data, nearly 70 percent of the officers who reported use of force arrests were men. 

[Name 2] said [information on whether women are more or less likely to use force and engage in arrests]. 

“Quote to support or go against this argument,” [Name 2] said. 

Though [Name 1] said the overpolicing of wards is a major concern, it is not a new concern. [Compare to data on past years and maybe connect it with the city’s history]. 

[Name 2] said the solution may be right in front of us—by revising and enforcing the annual anti-bias training required of all MPD officers. 

“Quote that supports this,” [Name 2] said. 

The data shows that nearly 77 percent of the officers had under 10 years of experience in the department, which [Name 2] said reflects how desperately these officers are in need of regular anti-bias training. 

“Quote on how young and old officers need training, but how newer officers especially need it so they don’t overstep and use force when not necessary,” [Name 2] said. 

Note on Data: 

As you can see from "My Data Analysis," I removed some of the data columns that didn't provide meaningful information to me, such as "IS_ID." I did not calculate any new columns, but the pivot tables helped aggregate and sum up some data I was curious about. I found the total number of officers assigned to each ward, the total arrests in each ward and the number of officers per year of experience. I kept the data in chronological order from the beginning to the end of 2024, but also sorted it to find that the most experienced officer had 41 years, while others had less than a year.  

In addition to sorting and cleaning all of the data, I created a few pivot tables to analyze it based on some questions I had. I compared officer race and gender to the number of arrests they made, as well as the number of arrests made per ward. I also created a chart reflecting the racial makeup of the arrests reported, per the use-of-force case data. This showed me a few things, which I mentioned in my mock-up article above, and led me to more questions I could ask experts and potential interviewees. I could also look into arrest categories and charge descriptions to see which were most common, and I could also ask MPD what these descriptions actually mean. Overall, there are a lot of potential stories in this data that might be worth exploring.
