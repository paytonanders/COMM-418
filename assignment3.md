... 
Note: 
As you can see from "My Data Analysis," I removed some of the data columns that didn't provide meaningful information, such as "IS_ID." I did not calculate any new columns, but the pivot tables helped aggregate and sum up some data I was curious about. I kept the data in chronological order from the beginning to the end of 2024, but also sorted it to find that the most experienced officer had 41 years, while others had less than a year.  
In addition to sorting and cleaning all of the data, I created a few pivot tables to analyze it based on some questions I had. I compared officer race and gender to the number of arrests they made, as well as the number of arrests made per ward. I also created a chart reflecting the racial makeup of the arrests reported, per the use-of-force case data. This showed me a few things, which I mentioned in my mock-up article above, and led me to more questions I could ask experts and potential interviewees. I could also look into arrest categories and charge descriptions to see which were most common, and I could also ask MPD what these descriptions actually mean. Overall, there are a lot of potential stories in this data that might be worth exploring.
