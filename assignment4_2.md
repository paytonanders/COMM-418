# Assignment 4.2: Creating a Data Set 
## <a href= "https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/19GqahZ-eXcwaaIsqI9Hoy_3an1FYSN_KAveNuAhKzx0/edit?gid=0#gid=0">Data collected</a> 
### Question: What social media sites do students rely on for breaking news, and what steps (if any) do they take to vet this information? 
* Following a recent rumour that a current AU professor was charged with impregnating a child in Mexico in 2017, I wondered how students go about vetting the information they see online. After this rumour was highlighted in a release of the Epstein files, many took it at face value. Students started petitions, protested, posted on social media, and engaged in other forms of activism without verifying the alleged charge or looking into the matter further. Now more than ever, citizen journalism is essential to hold those in power accountable; however, verifying information is crucial to prevent the spread of misinformation and disinformation. 
* That leads me to my proposed question, which I would attempt to answer by surveying college students in Washington, D.C., a politically active area for young people. I would use a Qualtrics survey and send it to students via email or by posting the link on social media. The data points I would collect may include where and how students get their information from social media apps, and what they do to verify. The data I have collected is only a small sample from students at American University, but I would plan to survey students at other campuses as well. Other data I may collect in the survey could be their years and majors, as some may have higher media literacy based on this information. Some issues may arise in the self-reporting of this data, as students could not be entirely truthful about how and if they vet their information, but these could be acknowledged in the reporting of the story.  
* It is unclear if I would need specific permissions to collect this data, but unlikely, considering I would collect based on consensual participation.
