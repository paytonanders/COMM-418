## Assignment 1.1: Data Story Critique
<a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/averhealth-drug-testing-child-welfare-michigan"> A Child Welfare Agency Doubted the Accuracy of Drug Tests Used in Court. The Testing Company Dodged Questions. </a>
The reporters used a variety of methods to gather their data, including interviews with former Averhealth employees, officials from Michigan’s child welfare agency, company representatives, people in family court and anyone else who may potentially provide more information on Averhealth and its drug testing methods. Reporters also used court documents and lawsuits, public records, and accreditation findings to detail how Averhealth operated, what problems were alleged, and how government agencies responded. When the data came from a tangible record of some kind, the reporters linked that to show where their data was coming from. They also linked any relevant public statements from agencies removing Averhealth from their process of familial evaluation and drug testing. Although the investigation relied heavily on the data reporters collected, whether it be qualitative or quantitative, it lacked visual reflections of these findings to break up the long text. When they could, the reporters included images from the actual Averhealth labs, but nothing related to the data they provided. The reporters did do a good job of breaking up the data and hard-hitting numerical facts with anecdotes from families impacted by Averhealth's inaccurate testing, which helped with the overall flow of the story while also humanizing the data they were presenting.
