## Assignment 1.1: Data Story Critique

The reporters used a variety of methods to gather their data, including interviews with former Averhealth employees, officials from Michigan’s child welfare agency, company representatives, people in family court and anyone else who may potentially provide more information on Averhealth and its drug testing methods. Reporters also used court documents and lawsuits, public records, and accreditation findings to detail how Averhealth operated, what problems were alleged, and how government agencies responded. When the data came from a tangible record of some kind, the reporters linked that to show where their data was coming from. They also linked any relevant public statements from agencies removing Averhealth from their process of familial evaluation and drug testing. Although the investigation relied heavily on the data reporters collected, whether it be qualitative or quantitative, it lacked visual reflections of these findings to break up the long text. When they could, the reporters included images from the actual Averhealth labs, but nothing related to the data they provided. The reporters definitely could have done more to not only showcase the data but also make it very clear to readers where the data was coming from. The Washington Post, for example, always has sections under its graphs explaining where the data was coming from and how it was collected. However, the ProPublica reporters did a good job of breaking up the data and hard-hitting numerical facts with anecdotes from families impacted by Averhealth's inaccurate testing, which helped with the overall flow of the story while also humanizing the data they were presenting. Beyond the coverage done by ProPublica, I would probably pursue a follow-up story of some sort to see if Averhealth has changed its methods or done anything in response to this investigation. Similarly, I would see if other agencies have stopped working with Averhealth or if any other families realized they were impacted by Averhealth's inaccurate testing. Overall, this investigation was well-reported and demonstrates how one can blend data and anecdotes to produce an impactful story.
