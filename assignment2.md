## Question: How many college campuses arm their local police officers? 
### Potential data set: <a href="https://bjs.ojp.gov/library/publications/campus-law-enforcement-agencies-serving-4-year-institutions-2021-2022">Campus Law Enforcement Agencies Serving 4-year Institutions, 2021-2022 – Statistical Tables</a> 
According to a Survey of Campus Law Enforcement Agencies (CLEA) conducted by the Bureau of Justice Statistics in 2021 and 2022, 95 percent of CLEA serving four-year institutions with 1,000 or more full-time students authorized the use of handguns for their campus police. This survey also collected data on agency staffing, operations, budget, policies, responsibilities, training and equipment. This data set was published in 2024 as part of a series on Campus Law Enforcement authored by Elizabeth Davis, a BJS statistician. Beyond the data summary the BJS provided, I also looked at the raw data collection they provided as a zip file on its webpage. This shows each survey that was conducted, as well as the standard error margin of the survey. This transparency tells me the data was meticulously collected, and there are no major errors or concerning pieces of information that may flag the set as unreliable. There is also a lot of data collected from a variety of public and private universities, indicating that the summary published by the BJS is based on trends, not one-off chances or non-factual assumptions. Additionally, the BJS also conducted this survey in other years, allowing them to compare their findings and ensure there are no drastic discrepancies between the years.
