Dear Editor, 

This story will explore, among other questions, how many college campuses arm their campus police officers. According to a Survey of Campus Law Enforcement Agencies (CLEA) conducted by the Bureau of Justice Statistics in 2021 and 2022, 95 percent of CLEA serving four-year institutions with 1,000 or more full-time students authorized the use of handguns for their campus police. This survey also collected data on agency staffing, operations, budget, policies, responsibilities, training and equipment. 

This data set was published in 2024 as part of a series on Campus Law Enforcement authored by Elizabeth Davis, a BJS statistician. Beyond the data summary the BJS provided, I also looked at the raw data collection they provided as a zip file on its webpage. This shows each survey that was conducted, as well as the standard errors in their survey collection and data. The BJS also clearly indicates which numbers are mere estimates and what specific dates and time periods apply to which data sets. The data also indicates a confidence level of about 95 percent, meaning Davis and whoever else from the BJS who worked on this survey and data collection are confident in the results provided by the survey.  

The BJS's transparency tells me the data was meticulously collected, and there are no major errors or concerning pieces of information that may flag the set as unreliable. There is also a lot of data collected from a variety of public and private universities, indicating that the summary published by the BJS is based on trends and not loose connections or coincidences. The BJS also conducted this survey in other years, allowing them to compare their findings and ensure there are no drastic discrepancies between the years. It is also important to note that the BJS is the United States' primary source of data on crime, criminal offenders, victims of crime and the operation of justice systems, asserting that it is a well-trusted and reputable source. 

Thank you for your time and I look forward to hearing your thoughts on this data set.

Best, 

Payton Anderson
