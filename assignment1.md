# Assignment #1
## Table #1: To what degree have students been published, whether online, in print, broadcast, or in some other medium, for consumption by a broad audience?
## Table #2: To what degree are students familiar with programming or scripting languages like Python, JavaScript, PHP, Java, C++, .NET, etc.?

  Before entering the first section of COMM 418, these students were tasked with completing a survey answering a few questions about their knowledge of collecting data and their experience in journalism, thus far in their careers. Among the few questions students were asked, they had to rank the degree to which their journalistic work had been published on a scale of zero to four. Zero represents a lack of publishing experience, while four represents a regular publishing experience. The published content could also include anything online, in print, broadcast, or in another type of medium. 
  <p style="text-indent: 40px;">
As seen in the table above, most students have had their work regularly published in some publication. No students asserted they have not been published, but about five of the 18 total students who completed the survey aligned with the publishing experience represented by a degree of four. Alternatively, 10 of the 18 students reported a degree of two or three, meaning they have been published a few times but not extremely often. The class data reveals that most of the students have journalism experience, which makes sense since almost all of them are journalism undergraduate or graduate students. Most students also work for on-campus publications like <a href="https://www.theeagleonline.com/">The Eagle </a> and <a href="https://thewash.org/">The Wash</a>, which would explain their experience with regular publication.

    Despite the clear publishing experience among these students, especially in digital publishing, there was an overall lack of experience with programming or scripting languages like Python, JavaScript, PHP, Java, C++, .NET, etc. On the same zero to four scale, 10 out of 18 students reported having no experience or knowledge about these languages, while one student reported a knowledge level of four. This drastic shift between the two data sets demonstrates a disconnect in knowledge amongst these journalists, which is interesting considering how highly digital and numerically-focused reporting has become. Based on this data, we can infer that these journalism students have a lot to learn about coding languages, which they can hopefully do at some point in this course.
